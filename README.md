# Vue.js Template with Typescript

This project represents the state of **my personal** Vue.js template with TypeScript. Feel free to use it in order to get a head start on your UI project.

## Used libraries

* **Vue.js** as UI framework
* **Vuex** for easy state management in Redux style
* **Vuex-Class** for vuex store via annotations
* **Vuetify** for Material UI design elements
